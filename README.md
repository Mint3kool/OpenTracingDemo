# openTracingDemo

The repository I have created when experimenting with OpenTracing.

This contains examples of creating spans, child spans, adding tags, etc. I picked swagger as the framework for simple manual testing; it is not needed for the opentracing implementation. 

This repository is intended to be paired with its sister repository [here](https://github.com/Mint3kool/OpenTracingReceiver). I decided to create a second repository to ensure that even with unique global tracers, that context would be propogated properly.
